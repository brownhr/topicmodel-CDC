# Data

## Twitter API

Twitter data acquisition on a large scale is made possible through the Twitter API v2 Academic Research Access, a platform designed by Twitter for use in academic and scientific research [@twitter]. Academic access differs from standard API access in that rather than limiting query results to only the last 7 days of public Tweets, the Academic Research Access allows for full-archive searching, as well as much a higher limit on the number of monthly Tweets able to be requested.

## academictwitteR

Query by "\@CDCgov" for Reply Tweets, and by "from:CDCgov" for CDC Tweets.
