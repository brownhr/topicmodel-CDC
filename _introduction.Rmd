# Introduction

## Research Question

This paper aims to develop the foundation of a method for predicting discussion topics on social media using *Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)* and multinomial logistic regression (MLR), for the purposes of increasing effectiveness of science communication programs.

## Background and Lit. Findings

While much research regarding text mining of Twitter data has focused specifically on the COVID-19 pandemic, little has been done to examine the public perception of government entities within the social media discourse [@dubey2020; @boon-itt2020; @manguri2020 ; @garcia2021].

### Sentiment Analysis

Much research regarding public opinion on the COVID-19 pandemic uses *sentiment analysis*, a dictionary-based approach to quantifying user sentiment (i.e. emotional valence); while this approach is useful for exploratory analysis of user sentiment, shortcomings exist when applying this model to "short-text" formats such as social media microblogging, comments, and Twitter posts [@boon-itt2020; @clavel2015; @dubey2020; @garcia2021; @liu2012; @manguri2020; @pak2010]. Due to these shortcomings (i.e. because the data in this analysis consists of *short-text,* with many Tweets containing fewer than 10 words), sentiment analysis was not performed within this study, the focus instead placed on abstract connections between topics generated by the methodology described below in Section \@ref(latent-dirichlet-allocation).
