# Abstract

Social media is a powerful source of data regarding individual perception of both public health policy and phenomena such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we perform topic modeling -- a statistical method capable of determining abstract "topics" within collections of documents -- on approximately 300,000 Tweets from January 1, 2019, to September 21, 2021, to better understand user sentiment and potentially conversational topics within the discourse. Topic modeling is performed on Tweets by the CDC's official Twitter account *"\@CDCgov"*, as well as on Tweets that reply to, quote, or mention the CDC's Twitter handle. Topic modeling is performed using *Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)*, with a value of $k =$ `r params$k` topics. The results of multinomial logistic regression give the odds ratios of Reply Topics per CDC Topic, showing distinct distributions of Reply Topics within each CDC Topic. This indicates that certain tweets by the CDC, such as those regarding mask mandates and vaccinations, are by large deemed "controversial" within public opinion and are significantly likely to receive replies of specific, "skeptical" topics, e.g. "Big Pharma" and government skepticism. The most controversial topic was *Masks and Mask Efficacy*, which produced an array of reply topics indicating a widespread distrust in governmental organizations and public health policies.
