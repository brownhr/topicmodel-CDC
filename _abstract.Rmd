# Abstract

Social media is a powerful source of data regarding individual perception of public health policy and phenomena such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we perform topic modeling -- a method of determining abstract "topics" within collections of documents -- on approximately 300,000 Tweets from January 1, 2019, to September 21, 2021, to better understand both user sentiment and conversational topics within the discourse. Topic modeling is performed on Tweets by the CDC's official Twitter account *"\@CDCgov"*, as well as Tweets that reply to, quote, or mention the CDC's Twitter handle. Topic modeling is performed using *Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)*, with a value of $k = 11$ topics. The results of the multinomial logistic regression show the probability of Reply Tweets of a given topic occurring on CDC Tweets of each topic, indicating that certain, potentially "controversial" tweets by the CDC , such as those regarding mask mandates and vaccinations, are significantly likely to produce replies of specific, "skeptical" topics, e.g. discussions of "Big Pharma" and government skepticism.
