# Discussion

## Controversial Topics

The Topics generated by *Latent Dirichlet Allocation* show a pattern of discussion among users that indicates a strong mistrust in government programs regarding mask wearing, vaccine mandates, public health, and basic sanitation. The most "controversial" of these is the `Masks-Mask-Efficacy` topic, which generated the largest and most divisive conversations; much of this division is linked to changes in federal mask mandates, specifically around the January 20, 2021 executive order requiring mask wearing in federal buildings, and in March 8, 2021, when the CDC no longer required fully vaccinated Americans to social distance or wear masks indoors (**LA Times Citation**)

## Applications

Several useful potential applications for this research exist; first, by using topic modeling, a better understanding of public perception of government programs can be achieved by "boiling down" potentially millions of data points into a discrete set of topics. Second, the relationship between Reply Topics and Parent (CDC) Topics can be modeled through logistic regression to establish a direct connection between the semantic topic of a public health message and the topics of user discussion. This relationship is vital to understand as it allows for better tailoring of public health messaging and science communication in general. By using machine learning models such as *LDA*, organizations can predict the expected Topic of a given message, which then can be used in conjunction with a logistic regression model to predict the expected distribution of topics of replies.
